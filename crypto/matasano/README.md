# Matasano Cryptography Challenges

## Set 1.
> This is the *qualifying set*. We pickked the exercises in it to ramp developers up gradually into coding cryptography, but also to verify that we're working with people who were ready to write code.  
> This set is *relatively easy*. With one exception, most of these exercises should take only a couple minutes.

1. _Convert hex to base64._
2. _Implement Fixed XOR._
3. _Decrypt a single-byte XOR cipher._
4. _Detect a single-byte XOR cipher._
5. Implement a repeating-key XOR.
6. Break a repeating-key XOR.
7. AES in ECB mode.
8. Detect AES in ECB mode.
